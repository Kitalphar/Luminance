## Description

This application is a Personal Finance Tracker designed to be a manual ledger-style tracker.
Essentially a digital version of a paper ledger that tracks balance and where the money goes.

 - Accuracy relies on user input.
 - No connection to banking systems, records have to be manually recorded.
 
 
The focus of the application is privacy.

 - Both the user's name and their database file name is obfuscated for security purposes.
 - User's database will be encrypted. Additionally sensitive data in the database will also be encrypted.
 - Local only, no plan for online syncronisation or cloud interaction.
